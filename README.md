## github-forks-addon

An addon to help you notice **notable** forks of a Github project.

Sometimes on Github, projects are abandoned by the original authors and the
development continues on a fork of the project. However, the original
repository is often not updated to say that. I have many times wasted effort
on making a pull-request or installing the old bugger versions of projects
when the community had already moved to a fork.

Moreover, the old project may have gathered a lot of stars, completely
overshadowing the new forks.

This addon adds a small sub-script under the name of the repository on Github
with a link to the most **notable fork**, if such a fork exists.
