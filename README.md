## Lovely forks

 - [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lovely-forks/)
 - [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lovely-forks/ialbpcipalajnakfondkflpkagbkdoib)

An addon to help you notice **notable** forks of a Github project.

Sometimes on Github, projects are abandoned by the original authors and the
development continues on a fork. However, the original repository is seldom
updated to inform newcomers of that fact. I have often wasted effort on making
a pull-request or installing old buggy versions of projects when the community
had already moved to a fork.

To make matters worse, the old projects usually have higher search-engine
traffic and a lot more stars than the forks. This makes the forks even harder
to find. This addon tries to remedy that by adding a subscript under the name
of the repository on the Github page of the project with a link to the most
notable fork (i.e. the fork with the most stars and at least one star), if such
a fork exists.

## Screenshots

The [tipsy plugin](https://github.com/jaz303/tipsy) hasn't been updated since
2012 and there is a [community supported
fork](https://github.com/CloCkWeRX/tipsy) which has merged in all the PRs.
However, the alternative only has 27 stars versus the 1,888 stars of the
original project (at the time of writing):

</p>

Similarly, the project [slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) was last
updated in 2013 and has about 5,000 stars. The [currently active
fork](https://github.com/mattr-/slate) only has 185 stars (at the time of
writing):

</p>

In some cases, a new flavour of the project might become visible, like an
internationalized fork ([Semantic-UI-pt-br](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-pt-br)
is [Semantic-UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) in a different
language):

Or provides new features ([vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) 
provides git integration for vim, 
[vim-mercenary](https://github.com/jlfwong/vim-mercenary) provides Mercurial
integration):
