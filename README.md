## Lovely forks

An addon to help you notice **notable** forks of a Github project.

Sometimes on Github, projects are abandoned by the original authors and the
development continues on a fork. However, the original repository is seldom
updated to inform newcomers of that fact. I have often wasted effort on making
a pull-request or installing old buggy versions of projects when the community
had already moved to a fork.

To make matters worse, the old projects usually have higher search-engine
traffic and a lot more stars than the forks. This makes the forks even harder
to find. This addon tries to remedy that by adding a subscript under the name
of the repository on the Github page of the project with a link to the most
notable fork (i.e. the fork with the most stars and at least one star), if such
a fork exists.
